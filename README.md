# Duel of the Numbers
A mixing of neuromorphic and quantum computing for the Comparative Machine Learning class

## The Game
A random number is generated and the player must make with their fingers the number of the primes of said generated number.  Neuromorphic hardware detects the number of digits via a convolutional neural network.  This is checked via generating the primes via quantum computing.  The quicker the primes are presented, the more points are recieved.  After one player plays a round, the robot turns to the next player, and the game continues.

## How it Works
Fingers are detected using a slightly modified version of Jared Vasquez's *How Many Fingers* [code](https://github.com/jgv7/CNN-HowManyFingers).
